<h1>What is your favorite WordPress function? Why?</h1>

<p><strong>My favorite WordPress function of late is <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter"><code>add_filter()</code></a>.</strong></p>

<p>With it, a skilled developer can change nearly <strong>everything</strong> about how WordPress works. A few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/The_WordPress_Gallery">WordPress galleries</a> offer an easy way for users to assemble a group of media. However, galleries’ default markup can be difficult to work with. I like to use <code>add_filter</code> to transform the markup into something that’s suitable for a slideshow.</li>
<li>WordPress extraneously wraps elements in paragraph tags, even images and videos. This isn’t very semantic. I like to use <code>add_filter</code> to hook onto the <code>the_content</code> to parse out the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>s.</li>
<li><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_title"><code>wp_title()</code></a>’s default behavior is kind of annoying because it often doesn’t include the site’s title on many views. Adding it manually using a filtering function does the trick.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Name three good reasons to start a branch in a version control system.</h1>

<ol>
<li><strong>Working on a project’s next major version.</strong> Make a new branch and add your planned features. This way, your new features are isolated from the production branch. When you’re ready to launch, merge ‘em.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging something <em>right now</em>.</strong> What if – while fixing <em>this</em> bug – you inadvertently cause another new problem? Instead of working directly on the production branch, it’s safer to isolate your code in a new branch. Fix the bug and merge ‘em up.</li>
<li><strong>Trying out an experimental feature.</strong> Say you want to drop some new hotness on your project, but you’re not sure it will work. Start a new branch to play with that fire. Doesn’t work out? Toss your branch.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Why is it better to use CSS (rather than JavaScript, if possible) for a basic web page animation?</h1>

<p><strong>CSS animations and transitions run faster than their JavaScript counterparts.</strong></p>

<p>A browser is able to execute CSS changes through the device’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU">GPU</a> when relying on CSS3’s <code>animation</code> or <code>transition</code>. This is <em>way</em> faster than relying on JavaScript execution, which is regulated by the browser.</p>

<p>The difference is fairly negligible on a desktop computer with a modern browser; however, the issue becomes obvious on mobile devices, where JavaScript execution is an order of magnitude slower than desktops and JavaScript animations are choppy, slow and hold up the page. </p>

<h1>What is your favorite project that you've done? (include link and/or image)</h1>

<p><strong>My favorite live project to date is <a href="http://swashcap.com/oregon-breweries/">Oregon Breweries</a>!</strong></p>

<p>It’s most fun to work on projects you care about. I’ve been fortunate to collaborate on several websites, but, to be honest, they’re all work. <em>Oregon Breweries</em> was different; it was self-initiated, and it grew from a newfound appreciation of craft beer.</p>

<p>And, the content is very relevent. According to <em><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/beer/index.ssf/2013/06/oregon_brewers_guild_nearly_on.html">The Oregonian</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>47 percent of all draft beer sold in Oregon was brewed in Oregon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty impressive, eh? To top it off, I got to learn some new things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data scraping and parsing</li>
<li>Interacting with the Google Maps API</li>
<li>Using PHP to parse an Atom feed</li>
<li>Using GitHub to (partially) open-source the project</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds like a win-win.</p>

<h1>Look at our portfolio and find something we've built that could be improved. Suggest how!</h1>

<p><strong><a href="http://equalityhouse.org/">Equality House’s site</a> looks great, reads great, and functions great; yet, there is a key area for improvement.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s talk about performance, specifically stylesheets. Remember <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">Yahoo!’s guidelines</a>: minify files, use less HTTP requests, compress files, etc.</p>

<p>On the home page, the site loads <strong>five</strong> stylesheets. (There’s another one hiding on the product page.) One results from Typekit loading, so it can’t be eliminated. The other four, however, could be compressed into a <em>single</em> stylesheet. This would decrease file size (by minimizing plugins’ CSS) and reduce HTTP requests, making the page load and render faster. Here’s how:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use WordPress’s <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_dequeue_style"><code>wp_dequeue_style</code></a> in the theme’s <em>functions.php</em> to remove plugins’ stylesheets.</li>
<li>Import all plugins’ stylesheets into <em>app.css</em> and minimize it.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is more work on the developer: when a vendor updates his or her plugin, you have to manually recompile <em>app.css</em>. In the end, it pays off in performance. (One could add an action function to do this every time a plugin or theme is updated. Plugin idea, anyone?)</p>

<p>Another consideration is that none of the stylesheets have a <code>Cache-Control</code> header, most likely because WordPress likes to set query strings on assets. Consider setting <em>app.css</em>’s <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_style"><code>wp_enqueue_style</code></a>’s <code>$ver</code> parameter to <code>NULL</code> so no query string is added.</p>

<p>Also, they’re not G-Zipped. Adding the appropriate rules to the global <em>.ht_access</em> should do the trick.</p>
