				<li>
					<h3 class="question">What is your favorite WordPress function? Why?</h3>
					<p>
					My favorite WordPress function is register_post_type. This is a basic function, but it's one of the main ways Wordpress can be expanded to use other post types and, therefore, exist as more than just a blogging platform but a full content management system.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3 class="question">Name three good reasons to start a branch in a version control system.</h3>
					<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Starting a branch allows you to delineate specific tasks more easily, such as bug fixes which can then be folded into the master branch. You can work on one task, check to make sure it works, and then add it to the stable, master branch.</li>
						<li>Similarly, a new branch is useful for testing new features or other experimental additions that may not be stable enough for the master branch.</li>
						<li>If you are working with other people on a project, </li>

				<li>
					<h3 class="question">Why is it better to use CSS (rather than JavaScript, if possible) for a basic web page animation?</h3>
					<p>
					JavaScript
					</p>
					<p>Additionally, loading JavaScript for something like a page animation, which is generally not a core feature of a site but rather a nice addition (mention progressive enhancement/graceful degradation?) costs the user a performance hit for something non-essential. Therefore, using CSS for page animations would be better in terms of performance, and if visitors to the site didn't have a new enough browser to render CSS3 animations, they wouldn't be missing out on a core feature of the site.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3 class="question">What is your favorite project that you've done? (include link and/or image)</h3>
					<p>
					The favorite project that I've done to date is my <a href="http://www.hannaliebl.com">homepage</a>. This was the first Wordpress site I built entirely on my own (using the <a href="https://github.com/zencoder/html5-boilerplate-for-wordpress">HTML5 Boilerplate theme</a> as a starting point). I wrote my own grid system.

					<h3 class="question">Look at our portfolio and find something we've built that could be improved. Suggest how!</h3>
