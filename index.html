					<h1>Hey there, Needmore!</h1>
					<p>I'm <a href="http://www.cpodemayo.com">Charlotte Koh</a>, and these are my answers to your questions.</p>
				</header>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h2>What is your favorite WordPress function? Why?</h2>
						<p>I am a big fan of the flexibility of <code>add_shortcode</code>, specifically because of how it can make it easier for end-users to embed media. This possibility came to my attention when I was attending a conference and sat in on <a href="http://lacytite.com/heweb12/wordpress.html#slide-23">a talk called WordPress FUNctions</a>.</p>
						<p>I work with people who are either unfamiliar or uncomfortable with manipulating code, so having the ability to simplify the process to something as friendly looking as <code>[yourvideo file='video.mp4']</code> seems pretty great.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Name three good reasons to start a branch in a version control system.</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>When you want to work on a bug fix</li>
							<li>When you want to work on a new feature</li>
							<li>When you want to experiment in general without affecting the main files</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Why is it better to use CSS (rather than JavaScript, if possible) for a basic web page animation?</h2>
						<p>CSS is faster than JavaScript since JavaScript must be interpreted by the browser. Also, since animations could be considered styles for the page (similar to hover states on links), it would make sense to keep animations with the rest of the styles in the CSS file.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>What is your favorite project that you've done? (include link and/or image)</h2>
						<p>My favorite project is the <a href="http://www.usf.edu/">redesigned University of South Florida website</a>. I began working on it in July 2011, and it launched Dec. 7, 2012. The project gave me the opportunity to dig into responsive design and coding for a large-scale website.</p>
						<p>What really excited me was the ability to make the website much more accessible than it had been in the past. I spent hours reading up on Section 508, WCAG and WAI-ARIA roles, as well as turning off images and JavaScript, navigating the site using only a keyboard, and increasing and decreasing font sizes. It was all worth it when I received an email from a woman who was happy someone working on the Web cared to take her vision needs seriously.</p>
					</li>

						<h2>Look at our portfolio and find something we've built that could be improved. Suggest how!</h2>
						<p>All of the websites in the Needmore portfolio, with the apparent exception of Savoir Flair, use WordPress. Of the WordPress websites that provide links, only <a href="http://gistbrands.net/wp-login.php">Gist Brands</a>, <a href="http://stumptowncoffee.com/wp-login.php">Stumptown Coffee Roasters</a> and <a href="http://loyly.net/wp-login.php">Löyly</a> have branded login screens. (The <a href="http://needmoredesigns.com/wp-login.php">Needmore website</a> also has a branded login screen).</p>
						<p>I would suggest implementing a branded login screen for clients by default. It’s a small detail, but it can help to tie together the whole experience for users. Also, while I can’t tell if this has been done, it would also be great to carry the branding through to the admin screen. It is possible to change the little WordPress icon next to the website name beneath the top navigation bar.</p>
