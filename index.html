					<h3>What is your favorite WordPress function? Why?</h3>
					<p>
					My favorite WordPress function is <code>register_post_type</code>. This function is one of the main ways Wordpress works as not just a blogging platform, but as a content management system. Behind this fairly simple function is the freedom to create different types of posts and to style them using the standard single-post and archive-post pages and to give them their own taxonomies, and that freedom and flexibility is why this function is my favorite.

					<h3>Name three good reasons to start a branch in a version control system.</h3>
					<p>
					<ol>
						<li>To keep things organized: starting a branch allows you to delineate specific tasks more easily, such as bug fixes, which can then be folded into the master branch. You can create a branch for one specific task, check to make sure it works, and then add it to the stable, master branch with commit notes, keeping things organized.</li>
						<li>Similarly, to keep the release version stable: a new branch is useful for testing new features or other experimental additions that may not be stable enough for the master branch. It's a way to try out different solution worry-free.</li>
						<li>To make collaborating with others easier: again, this is all related to the previous points, but you can eaisly push your a branch that has, say, a specific featue you're working on to the main repository so other developers can look at and use your work.</li>

					<h3>Why is it better to use CSS (rather than JavaScript, if possible) for a basic web page animation?</h3>
					<p>
					CSS animations are faster than JavaScript because they are rendered by the browser. They require less system resources. They don't require loading scripts and potentially libraries like jQuery, so it will decrease page load and bloat.
					</p>
					<p>You could also make an argument that using CSS instead of JavaScript for animation works with the principles of progressive enhancement. Any page animation is arguably not an integral part of the website's content. Visitors without modern browsers won't see the CSS animations, but they will benefit from not having to load and run scripts whose only purpose is to provide visual interest.</p>

					<h3>What is your favorite project that you've done? (include link and/or image)</h3>
					<p>
					The favorite project that I've done to date is my <a href="http://www.hannaliebl.com">homepage</a>. This was the first Wordpress site I built entirely on my own (using the <a href="https://github.com/zencoder/html5-boilerplate-for-wordpress">HTML5 Boilerplate theme</a> as a starting point). I wrote my own responsive grid system for it. I created custom post types and custom meta fields for the portfolio items, and in general, it was a long labor of love and design and development. It represented a step up for me in terms of design and breadth of Wordpress knowledge.

					Here are some screenshots of various pages at various screen sizes:
					</p>
					<div class="img-row">
						<div class="img-grid">
							<img src="./img/homepage1.png" alt="hannaliebl.com homepage screenshot" />
						</div>
						<div class="img-grid">
							<img src="./img/homepage2.png" alt="hannaliebl.com homepage screenshot" />
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="img-row">
						<div class="img-grid-full">
							<img src="./img/homepage3.png" alt="hannaliebl.com homepage screenshot" />

					<h3 class="question">Look at our portfolio and find something we've built that could be improved. Suggest how!</h3>
					<p>
					I think the Sierra Canyon Day Camp site could use a few improvements. First, I would suggest adding more typographic hierarchy. The headings, the navigation menus, and the body text all use very similar font sizes. You could play around with some size differention and maybe slightly change the color of the body text to stand apart from headings and the navigation, or even pair a different font with the body text.
					</p>
					<p>
					The titles of each page, when overlayed on the photographs, don't always stand out very well. Maybe making the text shadow larger, or even making the titles larger and in a different font (perhaps to match the typeface used in the camp's logo itself?) would help with that. It's nice that the sub navigation on the left side of the screen makes it clear where you are as well, but that top title just isn't very obvious or clear. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Finally, I don't like the second line in the top navigation bar and how it's pulled to the right. In order to highlight that nav bar in particular, I would center it, and potentially differentiate it from the top nav bar by color or font size or some other effect. It looks almost like an error- like it's meant to be a part of the top nav but there wasn't enough room for it. I can see in terms of the info in this "social" bar that it's meant to be different from the top nav, but visually there isn't enough difference, and the difference that is there seems off to me: there's a weird balance to having the top navigation floated to the left but almost taking up the entire screen, and then having a shorter nav bar floated to the right below it. Also, it seems like highlighting the "register now" link in particular would be useful for the camp.
