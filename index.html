					<hr />
					<p class="spaced-top-bottom center-text">
						Truthfully I'm not as well-versed in WordPress as I would like.  The authentication functions WordPress provides (e.g. wp_signon,  wp_logout, wp_create_user, and wp_update_user) are certainly welcomed by those who have tried to roll their own authentication system in the past on other platforms.

					<h1 class="center-text">Name three good reasons to start a branch in a version control system:</h1>
					<hr />
					<p class="center-text spaced-top-bottom">
						I use Git branches to test a new features, to easily revert to a previous state (should something get foobared), and to track work history.

					<h1 class="center-text">Why is it better to use CSS (rather than JavaScript, if possible) for a basic web page animation?</h1>
					<hr />
					<p class="center-text spaced-top-bottom">
						Speed!  The web browser can process CSS much faster than JavaScript.  In my book, CSS is for presentation.  Page animation falls under this category.  CSS3 support varies across browsers, so unfortunately some things still need to be done in JavaScript.  My rule of thumb is: CSS when you can and fall back to JavaScript when you must.

					<h1 class="center-text">What is your favorite project that you've done?  (Include link and/or image):</h1>
					<hr />
					<p class="center-text spaced-top-bottom">
						My favorite project thus far has been the redesign project I did for <a href="http://www.lasvegasfulfillment.com" target="_blank">Las Vegas Fulfillment</a> back in 2010.  It afforded me the opportunity to re-brand a company from scratch.

					<h1 class="center-text">Look at our portfolio and find something we've built that could be improved. Suggest how!</h1>
					<hr />
					<p class="center-text spaced-top-bottom">
						<a href="http://hunterqualitative.com/">Hunter Qualitative</a> stood out as being Needmore's least-balanced work on the color scale.  Perhaps later the client will be open to contrasting color blocks?  Like having the orange color block as the background for the nav, h1, and h2, with a muted blue for the rest of the page.  All other pages can have the nav in a contrasting color block as well.  Just one inexperienced chick's two cents.

== A NOTE OF THANKS  ==
My thanks to you nice folks for giving me an opportunity to do the code challenge!  I'm sorry it took so long.  I know it's disqualified me.  I had two family members in the hospital one right after the other. One will live, the other will not.  This code challenge has helped me to keep my sanity, so thank you again regardless of outcome!
